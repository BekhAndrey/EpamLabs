Cut me open and tell me what's inside
Diagnose me, 'cause I can't keep wondering why
And no, it's not a phase, 'cause it happens all the time
Start over, check again, now tell me what you find

It's like an avalanche, I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance, my heart has frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice

Am I broken? What's the chance I will survive?
Don't sugarcoat me, 'cause I feel like suicide
Just give it to me straight, 'cause I'm running out of time
I need an antidote, now what can you prescribe?

One thousand burning arrows
Fill the starlit sky

The ship glides gently on the waves
As day turns into night
